 #creating a tuple using ()
t = (1, 2, 3)

t2 = () #empty tuple
# t3 = (1) wrong way to print a single element tuple, it will bcome int
t3 = (1,) #singl element tuple

print(t) #printing tuple

print(t[0]) #printing elements of tuple (same indexing)

#diff btwn list nd tuple 
#tuples cannot be edited, they are immutable
